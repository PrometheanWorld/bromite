Subject: [PATCH] Force package name to org.chromium.chrome

This is so the package will match the list set in the core OS that
determines window settings:

https://gerrit-hk.waq.be/plugins/gitiles/AP9/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/res/res/values/config.xml#31

At some point this method should be changed to instead allow the
AndroidManifest.xml to determine the windowing state of the app.

Done for AP9-2571
